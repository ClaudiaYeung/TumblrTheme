# TumblrTheme

This code, crafted around 2011, utilizes HTML/CSS to construct a Tumblr blog theme. It encompasses features such as a music player, blog posts, and various links. If you'd like to view the Tumblr blog, the link is available upon request.

I've established this repository with the intention of digitally archiving and showcasing my interests and aesthetics from that specific period. Feel free to explore the code and the associated elements, offering a glimpse into the design and content preferences prevalent at the time. If you have any inquiries or would like the Tumblr link, don't hesitate to reach out.
